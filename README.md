In this project, the fluid dynamics equations were solved to create a simulation of the Kelvin-Helmholtz in-
stability between two fluid layers moving at different velocities, such as the Great Red Spot on the surface of
Jupiter. A sound wave propagation in the fluid is demonstrated as a test case in the first part. In the second
part, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is simulated for three cases with various initial parameters.
